<h1>Dreams Do Come True</h1>
<p>
I met you exactly 7 months ago, didn't know 
at that point of time that how lucky I will be to have to in my LIFE.
Actually kya tha na thak gaya tha sahi ladki aur sahi time ka intezaar
krte krte, so bas 7th DEC 2019 ko vahi thodi umeed and mere
pyare dosto k sath chal diye ek baar aur apki TAALASH me!
But who knew ki this time i will succeed?<br>
SECONDS PASSED....<br>
MINUTES PASSED....<br>
HOURS PASSED....<br>
DAYS PASSED....<br>
And finally the time/day came when we both started loving
each other, understanding each other, caring for each other,
and the most important we got CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER!
and trust me it was the best feeling !
Now being with you for past several months, i can PROUDLY 
SHOUT/SAY/ANNOUNCE that I HAVE THE "BEST GIRL" IN THE WHOLE
WORLD.<br>
YOU'RE MY DREAM GIRL!<br>
YOU'RE MY EVERYTHING !<br>
I LOVE YOU !
</p>
<h1>FLASHBACK</h1>
<p>
Let's go 6.5 months earlier ok?(lol how'll you reply)
Hmm, I vividly remember the moment when AKASH introduced
us! (HOPE YOU REMEMBER, WHAT DID YOU ASK AKASH?? HAHA.)
The one of the best thing about us is that firstly we became friends
then we become good friends and after that we started loving each other.
And surely there was something special in you that
I loved to talk to you and share everyhting with you idk why but there
was some sort of trust and i felt very comfortable in doing so.
Then we chatted more ..
we talked more..
I remember each and every video call/audio call with you because yaar
it gave me happiness infact it gives me happiness and i know
it  will keep giving me happiness throughout my life . 
You're such a gem of a person who understands me fully and was there 
with me in moment since we have met.
And soon i came to know that you are brilliant child too
(After the results(8 pointer)). Then there was a party for RAJAT's farewell 
and you know how special and beautiful it was for us! will always cherish
this all my life.
And my life completely changed from there a new chapter was opened into my book 
of life of "YOU"!
I have named that chapter "DREAMS DO COME TRUE", just wait for the right time.<br>
FROM THEN TILL NOW it has been a remarkable journey of my life.
Kya kehri ho boht paka diya bole jare jo apne aap me? lol.
Words, sentences, paragraphs, essays are too short to decribe the bond that we share and what do we feel 
for each other.I will always be thankful to you for accepting me and being with me
and supporting me and loving me unconditonally.
Looking forward to spend my whole life with you and i always keep writing for you
because your love cant be decribed it can only be felt!
!!Every single second my love for you grows!!
TAKE CARE MY LOVE !
